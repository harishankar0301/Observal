# Installation

Install the Observal CLI on your machine. The CLI is what you use to log in, instrument IDE configs, pull agents, and query traces.

If you also want to **self-host** the Observal server (API + web UI + databases), see [Self-Hosting](../self-hosting/docker-compose.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Self-hosting requires Docker Engine ≥ 24.0 with Compose v2 (`docker compose`, not `docker-compose`). Homebrew's Docker formula is outdated — install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or use your distro's upstream packages. Verify with `docker version` and `docker compose version`.

## Install (standalone binary)

The standalone binary is the simplest way to install. No Python required.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal/main/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest release binary for your platform and places it on your `PATH`.

Verify it worked:

```bash
observal --version
```

## Alternative: install with Python

If you prefer to install via Python, use one of these methods. Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

**uv (recommended):**

```bash
uv tool install observal-cli
```

**pipx:**

```bash
pipx install observal-cli
```

**pip:**

```bash
pip install --user observal-cli
```

### Optional extras

Observal ships with two opt-in extras for the Python install:

| Extra | What it adds | When to install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sandbox` | Docker SDK (for sandbox execution) | If you run agents inside Observal sandboxes |
| `migrate` | `asyncpg` (for the `observal migrate` command) | If you operate the server and run DB migrations from the CLI |
| `all` | Both of the above | If you do both |

Install an extra:

```bash
uv tool install 'observal-cli[sandbox]'
```

## Install from source (for contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal.git
cd Observal
uv tool install --editable .
```

## What gets installed

Four entry points land on your `PATH`:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `observal` | The main CLI |
| `observal-shim` | stdio shim between your IDE and stdio MCP servers |
| `observal-proxy` | HTTP proxy between your IDE and HTTP/SSE MCP servers |
| `observal-sandbox-run` | Sandbox runner invoked by Observal sandboxes |

You will almost never call the shim, proxy, or sandbox runner directly. The CLI wires them into your IDE config for you.

## Upgrade

```bash
observal self upgrade
```

## Uninstall

Standalone binary:

```bash
rm "$(which observal)"
```

Python install:

```bash
uv tool uninstall observal-cli
# or: pipx uninstall observal-cli
# or: pip uninstall observal-cli
```

Uninstalling the CLI does **not** remove your config (`~/.observal/`). Delete that folder if you want a clean slate:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.observal
```
