# Quickstart

Go from zero to "my first trace in the Observal dashboard" in about five minutes. This assumes you have Docker running.

By the end of this guide you will have:

* The Observal CLI installed
* An Observal server running locally
* The CLI logged in as an admin
* At least one MCP server instrumented
* A live trace visible in the web UI

## 1. Install the CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal/main/install.sh | bash
```

No Python required. For alternative install methods, see [Installation](installation.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You need Docker Engine ≥ 24.0 with Compose v2 (`docker compose`, not `docker-compose`). Homebrew's Docker formula is outdated — install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or use your distro's upstream packages. Verify with `docker version` and `docker compose version`.

## 2. Start the server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal.git
cd Observal
cp .env.example .env

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

That's it. The `.env.example` ships with working defaults. Eight containers come up:

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| API (FastAPI) | `http://localhost:8000` |
| Web UI (Next.js) | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Postgres | `localhost:5432` |
| ClickHouse | `localhost:8123` |
| Redis | `localhost:6379` |
| Worker | internal |
| OTEL Collector | `localhost:4317` (gRPC), `4318` (HTTP) |
| Grafana | `http://localhost:3001` |

The API waits for Postgres, ClickHouse, and Redis to pass health checks before starting — expect 15–30 seconds. Confirm it is up:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# → {"status": "ok"}
```

## 3. Log in

```bash
observal auth login
```

Prompts:

1. **Server URL** — press Enter for `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Login method** — pick `[E]mail`
3. **Email / password** — use one of the seeded demo accounts:

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Super Admin | `super@demo.example` | `super-changeme` |
| Admin | `admin@demo.example` | `admin-changeme` |
| Reviewer | `reviewer@demo.example` | `reviewer-changeme` |
| User | `user@demo.example` | `user-changeme` |

Log in as super admin for the fewest restrictions while exploring. Credentials land in `~/.observal/config.json` (mode `0600`).

Check it worked:

```bash
observal auth whoami
# → super@demo.example (super_admin)
```

## 4. Instrument your IDE

If you already have MCP servers configured in Claude Code, Kiro, Cursor, VS Code, or Gemini CLI, one command wires them all up:

```bash
observal scan
```

Expected output:

```
Scanning Claude Code config...
  ✓ filesystem        wrapped  (was: npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem)
  ✓ github            wrapped  (was: npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github)

Scanning Kiro config...
  ✓ mcp-obsidian      wrapped

Backup saved: ~/.claude/settings.json.20260421_143055.bak
3 server(s) instrumented across 2 IDE(s).
```

What `scan` did:

* Found your existing MCP config files (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, etc.)
* Registered each MCP server with Observal
* Rewrote the config so every server runs through `observal-shim` (transparent — no behavior change)
* Saved a timestamped `.bak` next to every file it touched

Nothing broke. Your agents still work exactly as before. The only difference: every tool call now generates a span.

Restart your IDE to pick up the new config. The next MCP call will produce a trace.

## 5. See your first trace

Open `http://localhost:3000/traces` in your browser. Trigger anything in your IDE that uses an MCP tool (ask Claude to list files, read a GitHub issue, whatever). Refresh — you'll see the trace appear.

Or use the CLI:

```bash
observal ops traces --limit 5
```

Drill in:

```bash
observal ops spans <trace-id>
```

## 6. (Optional) Pull an agent

Browse what the community has published:

```bash
observal agent list
observal agent show <agent-id>
```

Install one into your IDE:

```bash
observal pull <agent-id> --ide claude-code
```

This drops agent files, skills, hooks, and MCP configs into the right places for your IDE and wires up telemetry automatically.

## What you just built

```
Your IDE  <-->  observal-shim  <-->  MCP server
                      │
                      ▼  (fire-and-forget)
               Observal API  ──►  ClickHouse  ──►  Web UI, eval engine
```

Every MCP request/response is now a span. Spans group into traces. Traces form sessions. The eval engine can score any session.
