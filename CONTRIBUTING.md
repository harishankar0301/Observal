# Contributing to Observal

Contributions of all kinds are welcome — bug fixes, new features, documentation improvements.

## Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Observal.git
cd Observal
```

3. Add the upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal.git
```

## Development Environment

Requirements:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python 3.11+)
- Git

## Running Locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your values

cd docker
docker compose up --build -d
cd ..

uv tool install --editable .
observal init
```

The API starts at http://localhost:8000.

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed configuration and troubleshooting.

## Code Style

Python is linted and formatted with `ruff`. Docker files are linted with `hadolint`. Pre-commit hooks enforce both.

```bash
make format   # auto-format
make lint     # run linters
make hooks    # install pre-commit hooks
```

## Running Tests

```bash
make test     # quick
make test-v   # verbose
```

All tests must pass before submitting a PR. Tests mock all external services — no Docker needed.

## Branch Naming

Do not commit directly to `main`. Use prefixes:

- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation

```
feature/skill-registry
fix/clickhouse-insert-timeout
docs/update-setup-guide
```

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

```
feat(cli): add skill submit command
fix(telemetry): handle null span timestamps
docs: update contributing guide
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a PR against `main`.
3. Ensure linters and tests pass.
4. Respond to review feedback and update your code if requested.

## Issues

Check existing issues before starting work. For bug reports, include reproduction steps and environment details. For feature requests, describe the use case clearly. Discuss major features in an issue before implementing.

## Codebase Context

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for internal architecture notes, file layout, and conventions. This is especially useful when working with AI coding agents.
